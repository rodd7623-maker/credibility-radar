          <Section title="Overview">
            Credibility Radar ("we", "us", "the app") provides AI-powered analysis of
            text and voice content to help you evaluate communication credibility. This
            policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.
          </Section>

          <Section title="Information We Collect">
            {`• Account data: when you create an account, we collect your email address and an encrypted password hash.

• Analysis content: the text or transcribed voice you submit for analysis. This content is stored linked to your account so you can view your history.

• Subscription data: if you upgrade to Pro, RevenueCat (our payments partner) receives a pseudonymous user ID and your purchase receipt from Apple or Google. We do not see your payment card details.

• Device and usage data: standard diagnostic information (app version, OS, crash logs) used to improve the app.`}
          </Section>

          <Section title="How We Use Your Data">
            {`• To run the analysis you requested and return results.
• To save your analysis history so you can revisit past results.
• To authenticate you across devices.
• To process subscriptions and entitlements (via RevenueCat + Apple/Google).
• To diagnose crashes and improve reliability.

We do not sell your data. We do not use your analyses to train third-party models.`}
          </Section>

          <Section title="Third-Party Services">
            {`We rely on the following processors:

• Blink (blink.new) — authentication, database, and AI model orchestration.
• RevenueCat — subscription management.
• Apple App Store / Google Play — payment processing.

Each operates under its own privacy policy.`}
          </Section>

          <Section title="Voice and Microphone">
            Voice input is captured only while you are actively recording. Audio is
            transcribed to text and then discarded; only the transcribed text is stored
            with your analysis. We never record in the background.
          </Section>

          <Section title="Data Retention">
            Analysis history is kept while your account is active. You may delete
            individual analyses, or request full account deletion by emailing
            privacy@credibilityradar.app — we will remove your data within 30 days.
          </Section>

          <Section title="Children">
            Credibility Radar is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
            collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided us data,
            contact us and we will delete it.
          </Section>

          <Section title="Your Rights">
            {`You may:
• Request a copy of your data
• Correct inaccurate data
• Delete your account and data
• Opt out of non-essential diagnostics

Contact privacy@credibilityradar.app to exercise any of these rights.`}
          </Section>

          <Section title="Changes to This Policy">
            We may update this policy. Material changes will be announced in-app. The
            "Last updated" date above always reflects the current version.
